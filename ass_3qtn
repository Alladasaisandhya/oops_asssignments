#Task1: RaceCar
Now we need a RaceCar in our cars world.
A RaceCar is a Car but with the following additional behaviours.

horn sounds like “Peep Peep\nBeep Beep”
When a RaceCar is created it has 0 nitro points.
On applying brakes at more than half the max speed a Car gets 10 nitro.
When car accelerates & the nitro is available it gets additional 30% of acceleration value (rounded to int - ceil) as speed within max limits. And nitro get reduced by 10 points
Should be able to see nitro
Coding Guidelines:

Continue writing code in the same race_car.py file
>>> racecar = RaceCar(color="Red", max_speed=250, acceleration=50, tyre_friction=30)  
>>> racecar.start_engine()  
>>> racecar.accelerate()  
>>> racecar.accelerate()  
>>> racecar.accelerate()  
>>> racecar.current_speed  
150  
>>> racecar.apply_brakes()  
>>> racecar.current_speed  
120  
>>> racecar.nitro  
10  
>>> racecar.accelerate()  
>>> racecar.current_speed  
185 # 120 + 50 + (50 * 30 / 100)  
>>> racecar.nitro  
0  
>>> car.sound_horn()  # Prints
Peep Peep
Beep Beep
